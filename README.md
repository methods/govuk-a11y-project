## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Every year, millions of people visit the GOV.UK website to find information about government services. The website is designed to be accessible to everyone, including people with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. The website is also designed to be accessible to people who use assistive technology such as screen readers and speech recognition software.

The goal of the 2 week prototype project is to educate ourselves on accessibility and inclusivity, and to build a prototype using the GOV.UK prototype kit.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

We came up with the idea of building a Who Wants to be a Millionaire themed quiz game. The game is designed to be accessible to everyone, including people with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. The game is also designed to be accessible to people who use assistive technology such as screen readers and speech recognition software.
