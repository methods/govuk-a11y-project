## Task

The goal of the 2 week prototype project is to:

- Be able to work with the GDS prototype kit and have an understanding of the benefits of this design system; learn some components, styles and design patterns
- Understanding why website accessibility is important especially government websites. Includes some time reading about why accessibility is important - things one should be thinking about when building an accessible website should incluse
  - responsiveness
  - colour contrast
  - ability to navigate through page (use of tab)
  - ability for screen readers to read content and navigate website

- Website non-js friendly

## Team AccessForce Presents

AccessForce proudly presents our prototype for the GOV.UK website. The team comprises of [2 developers](#-authors) who are passionate about accessibility and inclusivity.

The project is a 2 week prototype project to learn about accessibility and inclusivity, the project is built using the GOV.UK prototype kit but modified to be a Who Wants to be a Millionaire themed quiz game.

## üßê Problem Statement

Every year, millions of people visit the GOV.UK website to find information about government services. The website is designed to be accessible to everyone, including people with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. The website is also designed to be accessible to people who use assistive technology such as screen readers and speech recognition software.

The goal of the 2 week prototype project is to educate ourselves on accessibility and inclusivity, and to build a prototype using the GOV.UK prototype kit.

## üí° Idea / Solution

We came up with the idea of building a Who Wants to be a Millionaire themed quiz game. The game is designed to be accessible to everyone, including people with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. The game is also designed to be accessible to people who use assistive technology such as screen readers and speech recognition software.
